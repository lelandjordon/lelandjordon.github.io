              I was reaching the end of my military music career and looking for
              ideas for building a second career.  I remembered that I was
              learning computer programming and physical science in high school,
              and I decided to take a look at modern computer coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was pointed towards online tutorials to get a feel for code.  It
              seemed easy, so I asked a friend, is it easier than I thought or
              am I just scratching the surface?  She said, "It's both.  It can be
              easy to start, but there is a lot to keep learning."
            </p>
            <p>
              So, I took some weekend workshops at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly">
                General Assembly</a> here in Washington, DC, in basic Web programming
                and iOS app development.  Impressed by my progress and by the
                community at General Assembly, and with the encouragement of my
                family and friends, I took the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">
                  Web Development Immersive
                </a> course in the spring of 2016.  What you'll find on my page here
                is just the beginning of what I've been learning about code.
